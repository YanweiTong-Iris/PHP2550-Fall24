# PHP2550 Project 1: An exploratory data analysis

## IMPACT OF WEATHER ON MARATHON PERFORMANCE ACROSS AGE AND GENDER

### Overview

This exploratory data analysis will focus on the following 3 aims:

1.  Examine effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women;

2.  Explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender;

3.  Identify the weather parameters (WBGT, Flag conditions, temperature, etc) that have the largest impact on marathon performance.
